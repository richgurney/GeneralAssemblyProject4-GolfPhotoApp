Golf App is a tool that can be used to document preparation for a golf tournaments.

## My Brief

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Have an API of your design**
* **Have an interactive front-end**, preferably using a modern front-end framework
* **Be a complete product**, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models
* **Use a database**, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **working front-end**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** - who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** - sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Link to your **pitch deck** - documentation of your wireframes, user stories, and proposed architecture
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome

##Technologies Used

##Approach Taken

I wanted to revisit my second project that I had built in Rails and replicate the techiniques I used but with Node.js and Angular. It was really important to me to impliment the use of AWS S3 to store photos. 

After writting some very simple user stories and drawing wireframes I set about researching all the techniques that I would need to know to get things working. I think the appraoch on this project was more based around a research and trial and error. I tested a lot of the seperate functionality in seperate apps which gave me a good understanding of what could and couldnt be done. 

My planning for this project was a lot simpler than my previous 3, but I think this didnt refelct the complexity of the techniques that I ended up using so this was a really big learning curve. 

I kept referring back to plans each day and accessing where I was in terms meeting my first MVP, things did have to change a lot throughout the project but I feel this a great starting point to continue to add other features.


##Things That I didnt get done and future changes

One of the aspects that I didnt get chance to add was a tool that would allow the user to annotate on top of the file that they just uploaded. I had this working in a seperate app but time was against me.

##Major hurdles in theis project

*Amazon AWS
